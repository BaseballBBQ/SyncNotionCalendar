# Automated synchronization of Notion databases and Apple Calendar

Do you often use Notion board databases for **roadmaps** or for your day-to-day **todos** ? Do you want your tasks to be automatically added to your Apple Calendar when a date is defined ? Hopefully you are on the good *repo*.

In brief here is a typical use case :  

1. You add a **task** in your board database, with a date specified
![](./img/add_to_do.png)
1. This **task** will be added to your Apple Calendar app
![](./img/task_calendar.png)

Then if the Notion card got modified or deleted, the changes will automatically be taken into account in the Apple Calendar.

*Note :* The synchronizations are trigered based on the crontab job you will define.

## Installation

In this section, I go through all the necessary steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Requirements
* macOS version 10.5 or later
* tested on python version 3.8.12
* pip requirements can be found [here](./requirements.txt)

If the previous requirements are fulfilled then follow these steps :

1. Clone the repository in your desired location
1. In your python environment run :
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Notion integration

You will have to create an internal integration in the Notion app. If you want to know how to get the Notion integration token, more info [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization).  

### Config file

After that, you need to create a config file in the root directory of the project. Name it **config.ini** and fill it as follow :

```ini
[GLOBAL]
NOTION_TOKEN=<your notion integration token>
APPLE_CALENDAR=<Name of your Apple Calendar>

[DATABASES]
<your chosen database name 1>=<notion database id>
<your chosen database name 2>=<notion database id>
```

You can add as many as you want **DATABASES** entries.

ðŸ’¡ do not forget to share your database to your integration

### Crontab job

Once you have done all the previous tasks, you only need to create a crontab job to run your task with the frequency you want.

Firstly edit [this script](./syncNotionCalendar.zsh) with your python interpreter path and your actual path to [main.py](./main.py)

Then open up a terminal and create a crontab job as follow :

```shell
crontab -e
```

It will open a vim editor.

Write : * * * * * cd <absolute path to the project> && <./syncNotionCalendar.zsh>

You can edit * * * * * to configure when to run the job.

ðŸ’¡ use [this site](https://crontab.guru) to generate the command.
